## Problem 1 (25 points) -- Portfolio Optimization

**Objective:** To construct and analyze a multi-asset portfolio by retrieving historical data, performing statistical analysis, and determining optimal asset allocations.

(a) Data Retrieval and Descriptive Statistics:
Using the tickers ['SPY', 'IEF', 'GLD', 'VNQ'], obtain five years of daily Adjusted Close price data. For each asset, calculate and report the annualized mean return and annualized volatility (standard deviation).

(b) Correlation Analysis:
Generate and present a heatmap of the portfolio's correlation matrix. Provide a brief commentary on the observed relationships between the assets.

(c) Minimum Variance Portfolio (MVP):
Calculate the Minimum Variance Portfolio (MVP) - the allocation that achieves the lowest possible risk. Report the portfolio's expected return, volatility, and asset weightings.

(d) Efficient Frontier Visualization:
Simulate a large number of random portfolios to plot the Efficient Frontier, displaying expected return against volatility. Clearly annotate the location of the MVP on the plot.

## Problem 2 (25 points) -- Gaussian Mixture Models  

**Objective:** Generate multi-cluster data and compare the performance of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) with K-Means clustering.

(a) Data Generation:
Create a synthetic 2D dataset with 600 samples and three distinct clusters. Sample from three different multivariate normal distributions. Ensure at least one cluster is elliptical (non-spherical). Plot the generated data, colored by their true cluster labels.

(b) Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM):
Fit a GMM with three components to the generated data.
Print the model's estimated parameters : means, covariance matrices, and mixing weights. Create a new plot showing the data colored by the GMM's predicted cluster assignments.

(c) K-Means Clustering:
Apply the K-Means algorithm with $k=3$ to the same dataset.
Create a plot showing the data colored by the K-Means cluster assignments.

(d) Comparison & Analysis:
Compare the two results visually with the original "true" plot.
Which algorithm (GMM or K-Means) performed better on your specific dataset?
